<p>
 Systems that support immunization information have a number of important responsibilities including:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Consolidation of Immunization records from various sources
 </li>
 <li>
  Supplying consolidated immunization history to users
 </li>
 <li>
  Forecasting next doses due
  <sup>

 </li>
 <li>
  Evaluating vaccine doses administered
  <sup>

  </sup>
 </li>
 <li>
  Supporting inventory management
 </li>
 <li>
  Supporting reports on vaccine usage by eligibility for funding programs
 </li>
 <li>
  Assessing coverage rates in a population
 </li>
 <li>
  Protecting the privacy of immunization data
 </li>
 <li>
  Supporting generation and sending of reminder notices
 </li>
 <li>
  Supporting tracking doses administered by lot so that recipients may be notified in the case where the lot is recalled
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 Each of these requires specific data. The National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) has identified a core set of data elements to support these responsibilities. These core data elements have been used to determine the usage in this guide. It is expected that systems that are using this Implementation Guide will be able to support these data elements and include them in a message. See Core Data Elements in Appendix B.
</p>
<p>
 These core data elements will also be included in conformance statements. This may be at the HL7 message component level or a data concept level.
 <sup>

 It is important that these data elements are supported by both sender and receiver.
