<p>
 This guide adheres to the following conventions:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  The guide is constructed assuming the implementer has access to the Version 2.5.1 of the HL7 Standard. Although some information from the standard is included in this implementation guide, much information from the standard has not been repeated here.
 </li>
 <li>
  The rules outlined in HL7 2.7.1, Chapter 2B, Section 2B5, Conformance Using Message Profiles, were used to document the use case for, and constraints applied to, the messages described in this guide.
 </li>
 <li>
  Data types have been described separately from the fields that use the data types.
 </li>
 <li>
  No conformance information is provided for optional message elements. This includes length, usage, cardinality, value sets and descriptive information. Implementers who want to use optional message elements should refer to the base HL7 V2.5.1 Standard to determine how these optional message elements will be used.
 </li>
 <li>
  This guide uses &ldquo;X&rdquo; as a conformance usage indicator very sparingly. Where the underlying standard indicates the segments/field/component is present for backwards compatibility (&ldquo;B&rdquo;) or withdrawn ("W") an &ldquo;X&rdquo; will be used. Some conditional elements may have a usage of &ldquo;X&rdquo; if the predicate condition is the only case where the element is used. For all other fields/components &ldquo;O&rdquo; is used to enable trading partners to explore additional capabilities. Note that without a clearly agreed to complementary profile between trading partners, a sender does not have to send any elements marked as an "O", nor does a receiver have to process any elements marked as an "O".
 </li>
</ul>

 The diagrams often show an IIS and an EHRs/other system. The other system may be an IIS.

 A Master Person Index is used by some health data systems to cross-reference a person&rsquo;s identifiers across these systems. If system A needs the person&rsquo;s id from system B, then it may retrieve it from the MPI. The Patient Idenitifying Cross-referencing (PIX) query asks for one system&rsquo;s personal identifier, based on another system&rsquo;s identifier. PIX is a profile published by Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE).

 The definition of &ldquo;exact&rdquo; is a local business rule and should be documented locally.

 If more than one client has a high-confidence match with the query parameters, this is an inexact match.

 The ability to send in an HL7 message is required for systems the output from clinical decisions support engines. The ability to consume is required for systems requesting evaluated history and forecast.

 For instance, the vaccine administered is specified as a required element of the RXA segment by indicating a Usage of Required on the RXA-5 field. The funding program eligibility is specified as conditionally required in a conformance statement not tied to a specific HL7 message component.
