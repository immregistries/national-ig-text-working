 C(a/b) - “a” and “b” in the expression are placeholders for usage codes representing the true (“a”) predicate outcome and the false (“b”) predicate outcome of the condition. The condition is expressed by a conditional predicate associated with the element (“See the Error section in V2.7.1 Chapter 2B). “a” and “b” shall be one of “R”, “RE”, “O” and/or “X”. The values of “a” and “b” can be the same.
</p>
<p>
 The example C(R/RE) is interpreted as follows. If the condition predicate associated with the element is true then the usage for the element is R-Required. If the condition predicate associated with the element is false then the usage for the element is RE- Required but may be empty.
</p>
<p>
 There are cases where it is appropriate to value “a” and “b” the same. For example, the base standard defines the usage of an element as “C” and the condition predicate is dependent on the presence or non-presence of another element. The profile may constrain the element that the condition is dependent on to X; in such a case the condition should always evaluate to false. Therefore, the condition is profiled to C(X/X) since the desired effect is for the element to be not supported. Note it is not appropriate to profile the element to X since this breaks the rules of allowable usage profiling (see in V2.7.1 Chapter 2B table HL7 Optionality and Conformance Usage).
