<p>
 Message content is governed by the cardinality specification associated (explicitly or implicitly) with each element of an HL7 message. Usage rules govern the expected behavior of the sending application and receiving application with respect to the element. The usage codes expand/clarify the optionality codes defined in the HL7 standard. Usage codes are employed in a message profile to constrain the use of elements defined in the standard. The usage code definitions are given from a sender and receiver perspective and specify implementation and operational requirements.

<p>
 The standard allows broad flexibility for the message structures that HL7 applications must be able to receive without failing. But while the standard allows that messages may be missing data elements or may contain extra data elements, it should not be inferred from this requirement that such messages are conformant. In fact, the usage codes specified in a message profile place strict conformance requirements on the behavior of the application.
