 The terms below are organized to move from the message to subsequently more granular components.

	<strong>
  Message
 </strong>
 : A message is the entire unit of data transferred between systems in a single transmission. It is a series of segments in a sequence defined by the message specifications. These specifications are based on constraints to the HL7 specifications, as described in an Implementation Guide.
</p>
<p>
 Example:
</p>
<p>

 The table above shows an immunization history for the patient identified in the PID. This person has one immunization ordered and recorded.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
  Segment Group:
 </strong>
 A segment group is a logical collection of segments. Segment groups defined within a message may be required or optional, may occur only once or may be allowed to repeat.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
  Segment:
 </strong>
 A segment is a logical grouping of data fields. Segments within a defined message may be required or optional, may occur only once, or may be allowed to repeat. Each segment is named and is identified by a segment ID, a unique 3-character code.
</p>
<p>
 Example:
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif,-webkit-standard;">
  PID|||12322^^^Assigning authority^MR^||Savage^Robert^^^^^L^|
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 This PID segment includes a medical record number and a person’s name.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
  Field:
 </strong>
 A field is a string of characters and is of a specific data type. Each field is identified by the segment it is in and its position within the segment; e.g., PID-5 is the fifth field of the PID segment. A field is preceded by the | character.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
  Component:
 </strong>
 A component is one of a logical grouping of items that comprise the contents of a coded or composite field. Within a field having several components, not all components are required to be valued.
</p>
<p>
 Example: RXA-5 administered code is composed of 6 components.
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif,-webkit-standard;">
  Code 1^text 1^code set 1^alternate code 2^alt text 2^alt code set 2
 </span>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
  Null and empty fields:
 </strong>
 The null value is transmitted as two double quote marks (“”). A null-valued field differs from an empty field. An empty field should not overwrite previously entered data in the field, while the null value means that any previous value in this field should be overwritten.
</p>

    Null fields (“”) should not be sent in immunization messages. Systems which will send null fields (“”) must specify their use in local implementation guides. Systems which will accept and process null fields, as described above, must specify their use in local implementation guides.

	<strong>
  Data type:
 </strong>
 A data type restricts the contents and format of the data field. Some data types are coded or composite types with several components. The applicable data type is listed and defined in each field definition.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
  Code Sets/Systems and Value sets:
 </strong>
 Most data elements will have associated lists of acceptable values in tables supported by a standards organization such as HL7 or CDC. These code sets will include definitions to support common usage.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
  Delimiters:
 </strong>
 Delimiter characters are used to separate segments, fields and components in an HL7 message. The delimiter values are given in MSH-2 and used throughout the message. Applications must use agreed upon delimiters to parse the message. Messages used in this Guide
 <strong>
  SHALL
 </strong>
 use the following delimiters:
</p>
<p>
 &lt;CR&gt; = Segment Terminator;
</p>
<p>
 | = Field Separator;
</p>
<p>
 ^ = Component Separator;
</p>
<p>
 &amp; = Sub-Component Separator;
</p>
<p>
 ~ = Repetition Separator;
</p>
<p>
 \ = Escape Character.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
  Message syntax:
 </strong>
 Each message is defined in special notation that lists the segment 3-letter identifiers in the order they will appear in the message. Braces, {}, indicate that one or more of the enclosed group of segments may repeat, and brackets, [ ], indicate that the enclosed group of segments is optional. Note that segments may be nested within the braces and brackets. This will indicate that the nested segments are units within a subgroup of segments. Their Usage is relative to the parent segment in the group.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
  Z segments:
 </strong>
 All message types, trigger event codes, and segment ID codes beginning with Z are reserved for locally defined messages. No such codes will be defined within the HL7 Standard. The users of this Guide have agreed to eliminate Z segments from their implementations in order to produce a standard method that will be used nationally to transmit immunization data. The query profiled in this document does have a name code which begins with Z as specified by HL7. This is not a Z segment.
