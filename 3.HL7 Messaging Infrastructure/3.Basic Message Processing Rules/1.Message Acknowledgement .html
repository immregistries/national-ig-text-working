 The conversation between a sending system and a receiving system consists of a Message (VXU, QBP) and a response (ACK, RSP). Receiving systems are expected to process the message and send a response. The system receiving the acknowledgement response does not acknowledge the response. In other words, the system receiving a VXU is expected to return an ACK. The system receiving that ACK is not expected to respond back to that ACK. Receipt and processing of ACK messages has a number of significant benefits:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Notification of errors and rejected data alerts sender that message has errors and may require correction
 </li>
 <li>
  Alerting sending user that the data did not get into the receiver’s system
 </li>
</ul>

    Some messages pass through intermediary systems like a Health Information Exchange (HIE). It is important that the intermediary system pass the ACK back to the sending system to allow the sending system to be aware of and deal with messaging errors.

  The HL7 Standard has two ways to convey acknowledgements: standard mode and enhanced mode. The scope of this document includes only standard mode acknowledgments, i.e. "application acknowledgements" only, which means that the receiving system accepts responsibility for the data or identifies the error in the message or rejects the message for a reason not related to the message itself.
