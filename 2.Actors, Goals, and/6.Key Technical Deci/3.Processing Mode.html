 Consolidation of immunization records from multiple sources is a complex process. Receiving systems have varying rules for this process. They expect complete immunization histories (i.e. all immunization information known to the sender). They don’t process in Snapshot Mode. (Incoming data completely replaces existing data)

 Note that receiving systems are responsible for publishing the business rules they apply when consolidating records from different sources.
