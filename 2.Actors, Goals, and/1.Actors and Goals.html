<p>
 There are a number of primary actors involved in data exchange. These include:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Immunization Information System (IIS)
 </li>
 <li>
  Electronic Health Record Systems (EHR-S) and other systems
  <sup>
   5
  </sup>
 </li>
 <li>
  An actor with a supporting role may be a Master Person Index (MPI).
  <sup>
   6
  </sup>
 </li>
 <li>
  An actor with a supporting role may be a Health Information Exchange (HIE)
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 This section will focus on the first 2 actors but will illustrate how the MPI actor may be integrated. These actors can be suppliers of information/data and consumers/requesters of data. We will consider the initiator of a messaging conversation the sender and the target of this first message the receiver. In some scenarios the sender may receive messages. For instance, a sender initiates a request for an immunization history for a client. The receiver responds with a message that is received by the initiating sender. For clarity, in this document, the initiator will keep the label of sender.
</p>
<p>
 Note that we do not assume that the sender or receiver is a specific data source (IIS or EHR). One IIS may query another IIS or an EHR-S. Similarly, an EHR-S may send an immunization history to another EHR-S.
</p>
<p>
 Other actors have an interest in the functions of an IIS and messaging. These include:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Clients/patients
 </li>
 <li>
  Users
 </li>
 <li>
  Policy makers
 </li>
 <li>
  Researchers
 </li>
 <li>
  Public Health agencies
 </li>
 <li>
  Clinicians
 </li>
 <li>
  Billing systems
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 These actors will not be directly addressed in this Guide. They interact with the primary actors to accomplish their needs.

 The table lists a number of messaging needs that relate to IIS and their trading partners. These are all candidates for HL7 messaging. Some are not currently implemented but give us the landscape that should be considered. Note that the messaging for maintaining of an MPI is out of scope for this Implementation Guide.
</p>
<p>
 Another way to organize these tasks or goals is to decompose the goals of the entities (actors) into the various roles they may play. These roles include:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  Immunization history supplier
 </li>
 <li>
  Immunization history consumer
 </li>
 <li>
  Identity resolution broker
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 Each of the actors above may have the capacity and interest to support some constellation of these roles. This approach is useful for system design and implementation and encourages a services approach to development. Since the goal of this chapter is to provide a non-technical view to help system managers understand how messaging can meet their needs, we will focus on the business entities and their goals.
