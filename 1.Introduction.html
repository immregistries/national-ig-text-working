<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Immunization Information Systems (IIS) are centralized population-based repositories of immunization related information. They receive and share data on individual clients/patients<sup>1</sup> with a number of other systems, including Electronic Health Record systems (EHR-S). Health Level Seven (HL7) is a nationally recognized standard for electronic data exchange between systems housing health care data. The HL7 standard is a key factor that supports this two-way exchange of information because it defines a syntax or grammar for formulating the messages that carry this information. It further describes a standard vocabulary that is used in these messages. It does not depend on specific software, that is, it is platform independent.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: initial; font-size: 1rem;">This document represents the collaborative effort of the American Immunization Registry Association (AIRA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to improve inter-system communication of immunization records. The effort has received input from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to improve the capacity to test conformance with this Implementation Guide. In addition, this Guide addresses a need to specify usage requirements for data elements that are not included in the standard HL7 usage designations. This implementation guide replaces the <em>Implementation Guide for Immunization Data Transaction Using Version 2.3.1</em> of the HL7 Standard Protocol, and previous versions of this Guide. It is based on HL7 Version 2.5.1, as published by the HL7 organization (www.hl7.org). In addition, it pre-adopts a number of features of HL7 Version 2.7.1, such as data types and the conformance model (defined in Chapter 2B)&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">As HL7 has developed and published new versions of the standard, it has sought to maximize the ability of implementations, based on newer versions&#39; ability to accept messages from earlier versions. Based on this, we anticipate that faithful implementations of this Guide will be able to accept most immunization messages based on the 2.3.1 Guide. Note that variations in current 2.3.1 interfaces increase the risk that faithful 2.5.1 implementations will encounter problems with 2.3.1 messages.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><table style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td class="fr-thick " style="width: 100.0000%;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Implementations that are supporting Version 2.3.1 messages should continue to follow the specifications of 2.3.1 messages described in the Implementation Guide Version 2.2, June 2006.</span><br></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p>
