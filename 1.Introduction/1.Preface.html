<p>The CDC, in collaboration with the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and the American Immunization Registry Association (AIRA), developed this interim, computable version of the consolidated HL7 v2.5.1 Implementation Guide for Immunization Messaging, or National Implementation Guide (IG) (https://repository.immregistries.org/resource/hl7-version-2-5-1-implementation-guide-for-immunization-messaging-release-1-5-1/) using NIST&rsquo;s Implementation Guide and Authoring Management Tool (IGAMT). Prior to this work, only PDF and Word versions of the National IG were available, which made comparisons difficult - between the National IG and IIS local IGs, and between local IGs. Absence of a computable National IG also created challenges for provider onboarding and message testing with jurisdictional HL7 specific requirements. Having a computable National IG has broad applicability across several CDC and AIRA projects. Additionally, the computable National IG can serve as a valuable resource for any potential future updates to the current National IG. At the local level, local IGs can be derived from the computable National IG, reducing the burden of data entry and maintenance of the local IG. In turn, this will make development of the updated version less burdensome and more consistent. &nbsp;</p><p>To make the National IG computable, a workgroup consisting of representatives from CDC, AIRA, and NIST met regularly to enter the National IG into IGAMT, resolve issues, and to make recommendations for potential changes. As needed, experts outside the group were also contacted for opinions on various issues that arose during data entry and review. Based on this work, The Interim, Computable Implementation Guide for Immunization Messaging, or ICIG, was created. &nbsp;</p><p>While various formats of the ICIG are available, such as XML and Word, the preferred format is HTML. &nbsp;The HTML format, available on NIST&rsquo;s website (https://hl7v2.igamt-2.nist.gov/igamt/home), provides the best user experience, by allowing users to work with the ICIG using the full range of NIST&rsquo;s HL7-related tooling. For users not interested in using other NIST tools, the HTML format allows users to easily switch between profiles, segments, subcomponents, etc. to better understand requirements stated in the ICIG. Additionally, users can see how different segments and components are used within the ICIG and how they are related to one another, by selecting &ldquo;Cross References&rdquo; under the segment or component of interest. Therefore, it is heavily suggested that users of the ICIG access the HTML format of the document.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to note that while the ICIG is mainly based on the National IG, there are differences between the National IG and the ICIG. Often this was due to a newer conformance methodology implemented in IGAMT that did not exist during the development of the National IG. In these cases, or in situations where guidance provided by the National IG was unclear, the v2.8.2 Implementation Guide: Immunization Messaging (http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=490) was used to supplement the National IG. If the v2.8.2 IG was unclear, or did not contain required information, the IG used as the specification for in NIST&rsquo;s Immunization Test Suite (https://hl7v2-iz-r1.5-testing.nist.gov/iztool/#/cf) served as an additional reference document. Also, it should be noted, that there were additional differences between the National IG and ICIG, due to clarifications discussed and decided upon by the workgroup during the data entry and review process. Specific information about differences between the National IG and the ICIG can be found in Appendix C.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to these differences, this IG serves as interim documentation and is <strong>only to be used by CDC&rsquo;s Immunization HL7 Project Team and AIRA&rsquo;s Onboarding Shared Services (OSS) team</strong>, until differences can be accounted for in a new version of the National IG.
