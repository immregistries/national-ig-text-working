 This Guide is intended to facilitate the exchange of immunization records between different systems

 . This includes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Sending and receiving immunization histories for individuals
 </li>
 <li>
  Requesting immunization histories for individuals
 </li>
 <li>
  Requesting an evaluated history and forecast for individuals
 </li>
 <li>
  Responding to requests for immunization histories by returning immunization histories
 </li>
 <li>
  Responding to requests for evaluated history and forecast
 </li>
 <li>
  Acknowledging receipt of immunization histories and requests for immunization histories
 </li>
 <li>
  Reporting errors in the messaging process
 </li>
 <li>
  Sending observations about an immunization event (this may include patient eligibility for a funding program, reactions, forecasts and evaluations).
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 The Guide is not intended to specify other issues such as:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Business rules, which are not implicit in HL7, applied when creating a message
 </li>
 <li>
  Business rules, which are not implicit in HL7, applied when processing a received message
 </li>
 <li>
  A standard transport layer
 </li>
 <li>
  Search process used when responding to a query
 </li>
 <li>
  Business rules used to deduplicate clients or events
 </li>
 <li>
  Management of vaccine inventory
 </li>
 <li>
  Maintenance of Master Person Index (MPI).

</ul>

 Local implementations are responsible for the important issues described above. One way to insure success is to publish a local profile or implementation guide that outlines the local business rules and processes. These guides may further constrain this Guide but may not contradict it. This Guide will identify some of the key issues that should be addressed in local profiles.

<p>
 This Guide makes the following assumptions:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Infrastructure is in place to allow accurate and secure information exchange between information systems.
  <sup>
   4
  </sup>
 </li>
 <li>
  Providers access immunization information through either an EHR-S or immunization information system (IIS).
 </li>
 <li>
  Privacy and security have been implemented at an appropriate level.
 </li>
 <li>
  Legal and governance issues regarding data access authorizations, data ownership and data use are outside the scope of this document.
 </li>
 <li>
  The immunization record and demographic record for each patient contains sufficient information for the sending system to construct the immunization and demographic message properly.
 </li>
 <li>
  External business rules are assumed to be documented locally.
 </li>
</ul>

    It is important to be able to accept complete immunization histories from different sources and have a method for integrating them. This implies that a system should not assume that any record sent is “new”. If the system makes this assumption and receives a complete history that has overlapping immunization records, there is a risk for duplicate records.
    <p>
     There is “best practice” guidance on handling this from the American Immunization Registry Association (AIRA) in the Modeling Immunization Registry Operations Workgroup (MIROW) documents available on the AIRA website. (immregistries.org)
