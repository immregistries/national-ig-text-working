<p>This Guide has two audiences. The first is the system managers that must understand this process at a high level. The second is the technical group from IIS and EHR-S that must implement these guidelines. For them we strive for an unambiguous specification for creating and interpreting messages. Our goal is for this Guide to be a bridge between the two.</p><p>It is important to note that HL7 specifies the interface between 2 systems. It does not specify how any given system is implemented to accomplish the goals of messaging.</p>
