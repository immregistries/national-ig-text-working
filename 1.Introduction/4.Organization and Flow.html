	The first two chapters are meant to lay out what can be done and why. The chapters that follow them describe and specify how. Message profiles will support the major use cases outlined below. Each profile will be in a separate chapter. All profiles will rely on the data type definitions in Chapter 4. Several appendices support implementers with value sets and examples of use.

	Note that requesting an immunization history may require interaction with an MPI or other identity source. Those using these services should consult with profiles or "implementation guides" that support this. Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) has profiles that support MPI maintenance and identity resolution.
