<p>
 This appendix explains the differences between the Interim, Computable Implementation Guide for Immunization Messaging (ICIG) and the consolidated version of the HL7 v2.5.1 Implementation Guide for Immunization Messaging and associated Addendum, or National IG (https://repository.immregistries.org/resource/hl7-version-2-5-1-implementation-guide-for-immunization-messaging-release-1-5-1/) and serves as a reference of differences between the National IG and ICIG. While most of the differences between the IGs are minor, there are a few notable changes. For specific information on these differences please refer to the following sections of this appendix: &ldquo;Differences Due to IGAMT Conformance Methodology&rdquo;, which summarizes differences due to newer conformance methodology requirements that exist in IGAMT, and &ldquo;v2.5.1 Clarification Points&rdquo;, which summarizes differences as discussed and decided upon by the workgroup.
