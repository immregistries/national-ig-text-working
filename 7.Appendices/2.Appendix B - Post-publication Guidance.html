<p>
 The following guidance information was developed after the original guide publication to solve specific interoperability issues not completely addressed by Release 1.5. While not binding on implementers, the contents of these guidance documents are essential for understanding current implementations and the future direction of the community. Future releases will require support for many of the recommendations in these documents. Implementers will benefit now by adopting these best practices in the current version.
