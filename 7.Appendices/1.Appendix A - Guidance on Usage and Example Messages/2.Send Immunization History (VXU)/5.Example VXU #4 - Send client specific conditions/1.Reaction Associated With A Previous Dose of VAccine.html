<p>
 Some people experience adverse events after receipt of an immunization. In many cases, Immunization Information Systems (IIS) record these in conjunction with a specific immunization event. Occasionally, the exact immunization event information is unknown. (e.g. anaphylaxis occurred after a previous dose, years in the past.)
