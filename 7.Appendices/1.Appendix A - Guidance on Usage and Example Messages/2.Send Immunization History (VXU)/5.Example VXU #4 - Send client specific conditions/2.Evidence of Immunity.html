 Infection with the diseases that are the target of immunizations leads to long-term immunity. Further immunization against the disease is not likely to provide benefit.

</p>
<p>
 Evidence of immunity indicates that a person has plausible evidence that they have already developed immunity to a particular disease. The strongest evidence of immunity is when serological evidence indicates immunity. An alternative evidence of immunity is when a clinician has determined that the patient has a history of the disease.

<p>
 The example below shows that no dose of vaccine was given because the person had evidence of previous infection with Hep B.
