 Clients or their parents may choose not to be immunized against a particular disease or diseases. It is important to share this information when sending immunization histories using HL7. There are several components to messaging a refusal. The refusal reason is indicated in RXA-18. The Completion Status in RXA-20 indicates that the vaccine was not given. The amount given should be 0. The following example illustrates how to accomplish this.

<p>
	<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif,-webkit-standard;">
  ORC|RE||9999^DCS|||||||^Clerk^Myron &lt;CR&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif,-webkit-standard;">
  RXA|0|1|20091010||107^DTAP-NOS^CVX|999||||||||||||00^Parental refusal^NIP002||RE&lt;CR&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 This example shows that on 10/10/2009 this client’s parent refused to have the child receive a DTAP immunization. Note that the ORC is still required. Filler Order Number is still required, but meaningless.
