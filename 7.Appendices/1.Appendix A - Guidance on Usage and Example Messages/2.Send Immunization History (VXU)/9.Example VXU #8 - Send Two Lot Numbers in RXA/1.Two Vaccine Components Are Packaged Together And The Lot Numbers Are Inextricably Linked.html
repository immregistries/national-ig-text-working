<p>
 There are occasions when two vaccines or a vaccine component, such as a diluent are combined at the time of administration. This does not apply to the case where an adjuvant must be reported as well as the vaccine. (See below) In most cases, the components are packaged together, and the lot numbers of each component are linked by the manufacturer. In this case record it is not necessary to message both lot numbers.

 For example, if we needed to include an immunization record where the vaccine was Pentacel, we would put the lot number from the first component in sequence 15. The specific RXA field is highlighted below in yellow.
