 The following activity diagram illustrates the process of sending and receiving an immunization history. It is meant to be illustrative and not prescriptive. With the exception of the HL7 message structure processing and the return of an acknowledgement, the activities are based on local business rules. These rules must be documented for smooth interoperability. HL7 only addresses the messages, VXU and ACK.

  The process for sending a VXU (Immunization history) begins with the sending system building the VXU message.
 </li>
	<li>
  The sending system connects to the receiving system and sends the VXU.
 </li>
	<li>
  The receiving system accepts the message.
 </li>
	<li>
  The receiving system parses the message and validates.

 Note that sending system may indicate that it does not accept acknowledgement messages. In this case, no acknowledgement is returned. This is not recommended.

 It is expected that a client's immunization history is the complete history known to the sending system, and not just updates on new information in the sending system. While some systems may send updates only, the receiving system should make no assumptions about this. This has important implications for processing those incoming records. At the same time, the sending system may not know of all immunizations, so receiving system must have a process for integrating the received data into an existing record. The Modeling Immunization Registry Operations Workgroup (MIROW) has produced a chapter of best practices on this process. This is available on the American Immunization Registry Association web site (www.immregistries.org).

 The following example messages represent straightforward immunization history messages. They do not illustrate dealing with specific use cases, such as messaging reactions, client specific conditions or vaccine forecasts. Clearly, these may be components of a VXU, but will be addressed separately to simplify the messages.

    It is important to reiterate here that conformant systems should be able to successfully populate and process the VXU message segments and fields identified as Required or Required but may be empty. They should be able to populate and process conditional items when the predicate conditions are met. If segments or fields are optionally repeating, they should be able to gracefully handle the repetitions. Systems that do not conform to these expectations risk missed data.
