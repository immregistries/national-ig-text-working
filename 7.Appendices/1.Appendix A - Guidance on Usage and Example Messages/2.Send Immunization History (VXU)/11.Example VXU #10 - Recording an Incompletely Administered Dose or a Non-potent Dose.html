 There are occasions when a dose is not completely administered. For example, a child may jump away during injection and an unknown quantity was administered. In this case, the dose needs to be recorded to support accurate inventory management and to allow for recall of the client if there is a recall of the vaccine. This is accomplished using the Completion status in RXA-20. The RXA is completed as usual, but the completion status is set to PA. If more details are of interest, then this information may be placed in an NTE segment under an OBX segment.
