<p>Some systems may not have the capability to capture eligibility for each immunization administered. The eligibility should be messaged using the OBX with each immunization record. Ideally, these systems would know the vaccines that are VFC eligible (or state program eligible) and correctly associate VFC eligibility with each vaccine administered. In practical terms, if the person was VFC eligible because they were covered by MEDICAID, and received 2 doses of vaccine, each vaccine record would have an associated OBX segment. These segments would indicate V02 as the eligibility.</p>
