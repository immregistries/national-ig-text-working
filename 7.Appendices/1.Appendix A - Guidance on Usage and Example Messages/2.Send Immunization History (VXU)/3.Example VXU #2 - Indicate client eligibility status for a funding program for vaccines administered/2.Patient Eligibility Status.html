<p>In the past, eligibility was recorded for each visit where a patient received an immunization. Recent guidance from the Modeling Immunization Registry Operations Workgroup (MIROW)<sup>37&nbsp;</sup>has clarified that the eligibility status of the patient should be recorded for each vaccine dose administered. It does not need to be recorded for immunizations that represent a historical record of an immunization.</p><p>Sending systems which collect the eligibility status for each visit will need to associate the status recorded for that visit on each immunization administered at that visit. They should consider if the vaccine administered was eligible for the funding program when deciding what to assign as the eligibility for each immunization.</p><p>The method of capture is messaged in OBX-17 (observation method). If the eligibility is captured by vaccine dose, OBX-17 will be valued:</p><p>&ldquo;VXC40^per immunization^CDCPHINVS&rdquo;</p><p>If the method of capture is per visit, OBX-17 shall be valued:</p><p>&ldquo;VXC41^per visit^CDCPHINV&rdquo;</p><p>Patient Eligibility Status is conveyed in an OBX segment for each vaccine dose administered. While this document will describe how to accomplish this in an HL7 message and give a high-level view of patient eligibility status, readers should refer to the MIROW document for a complete understanding of correct usage.</p><p>As described in the MIROW document, a variety of factors play a role in determination of Patient Eligibility Status: VFC and grantee policies, age, private insurance coverage, type of provider, and type of vaccine to be administered. For instance a person who was an Alaska Native receiving an MMR would have an eligibility status code of V04. The following table gives a simplified view of the most common cases.</p><p><br></p><table style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td class="fr-thick " style="width: 100.0000%;">Technical Note: The design of the information systems interface and validation functionality should ensure a match between reported/messaged Patient Eligibility Status and administered Vaccine Eligibility Status &ndash; they have to be eligible for the same funding program.
