    Federal regulations specify that Patient Eligibility status be assessed at each immunization encounter. It is a key data element for creating the Vaccines for Children (VFC) report on vaccine usage. Support for this report requires that systems store a history of eligibility statuses at the dose administered level.

 Immunization messages must be able to convey the eligibility status of a recipient when they received immunizations. That is, for each dose administered, the person’s eligibility should be recorded. Eligibility refers to what funding program should pay for the vaccine. This is distinctly different from funding source, which refers to what funding program actually paid for the vaccine. This document will illustrate the former.
