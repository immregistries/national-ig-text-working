 Sending an acknowledgement can accomplish one of a number of tasks. It can indicate that the message that was sent was successfully received and processed. It can also indicate that the message had errors.

    The ability to accept ACK messages allows sending system managers to trouble-shoot communications. It allows them to identify systematic problems with message creation. Being able to send ACK allows receiving system managers to inform sending system managers about the nature of errors received. The process can keep senders informed that some or all of the data they had sent did not make it into the receiving system.

     It is vital that when messages are passed on by an intermediary, like a Health Information Exchange (HIE), the ACK is passed back to the initiating system.

 Errors may be of a number of types. The error may be caused by:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
  A violation of an HL7 standard
 </li>
	<li>
  A violation of local processing rules
 </li>
	<li>
  A failure in the transport layer between the 2 systems
 </li>
	<li>
  A failure by the sending system to be authenticated by the receiving system
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>
  Only the first 2 types of errors are addressed by this Implementation Guide.
