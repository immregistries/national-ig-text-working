<p>When a system receives a QBP^Q11 Request for Immunization History query, it may find one or more, lower confidence candidates. In this case it returns an RSP that contains a list of these candidates. It includes all pertinent information in PID, NK1 and PD1 segments. If the number of candidates is greater than the maximum number requested by the querying system or greater than the maximum number the responding system allows to be returned, then an error acknowledgment will be sent. (See below)</p><p><br></p><table style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td class="fr-thick" style="width: 100.0000%;">Note that PID-1, Set Id, is required when returning a list of PID. It is incremented for each PID returned (i.e. 1,2,3&hellip;)<br></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p><p>The following example RSP message illustrates the case when 2 candidates have been found by the responding system. All known information for each candidate that can be included in PID, NK1 and PD1 segments is returned. We assume that the medical record number sent in the query is not known to the responding system. If it were, it is unlikely that the responding system would find lower confidence candidates.</p><p><br></p><table style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td class="fr-thick " style="width: 100.0000%;">The actual logic used to find the candidates is not specified by this document.
