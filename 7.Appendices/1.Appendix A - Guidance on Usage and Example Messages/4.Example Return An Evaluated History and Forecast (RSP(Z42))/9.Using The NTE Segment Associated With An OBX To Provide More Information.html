 Each OBX may have an associated NTE segment. This may be used for sending notes or comments that the receiving system may choose to display to a user. Any use of this is local and requires local documentation.

      There are some series where doses may be skipped. For instance, a person who gets significantly behind on some HIB series may skip a dose and complete &ldquo;early&rdquo;. Local profiles should specify how these doses will be handled and messaged.
     </li>
     <li>
      Some vaccines have a numbered primary series and are followed by intermittent booster doses. These do not increase the number of doses in the primary series.
     </li>
     <li>
      Persons who have been previously infected may not need further doses of vaccine. This can be messaged in an OBX reporting client immunity.
