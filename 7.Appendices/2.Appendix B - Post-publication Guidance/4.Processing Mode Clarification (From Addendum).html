 Chapter 2 includes a section entitled "Processing Mode" which discusses consolidation of records from multiple sources. However, messages conforming to the different profiles described by this guide may be populated with different quantities of data depending on the profile they conform to.

<ul>
	<li>
  Z22 (Transmit Unsolicited Vaccine Update &mdash; VXU): The goal of a Z22 message is to send up-to-date information about a vaccination event and the patient receiving the vaccine. A conformant message may contain a view of the entire patient vaccination history as known by the system originating the VXU^V04 message, but it is not required to do so. In other words, a given Z22 conformant message may only contain a subset of all vaccination events on the patient record, typically only those that have been added, updated or deleted as part of the event leading to the triggering of a message. The receiving system is responsible for applying business rules to integrate the data received but should not assume that the message being processed represents the entire patient vaccination history. The data within any single order group (set of one ORC segment, one RXA segment and associated RXR and OBX segments, if any) should represent the complete set of data about the vaccination event as known by the system originating the message. A complete set of data is defined by the required (as per this implementation guide) and locally agreed to data elements.
 </li>
	<li>
  Z32 (Return complete immunization history): The goal of the Z32 is to return a complete immunization history in response to a query request. Conformant messages should contain a view of the entire patient vaccination history as known by the system that originates the RSP^K11 message. The receiving system may process the message as required by local rules and needs. Depending on the situation and construction of the receiving system data base, the content of the message may completely overwrite existing query response data or may need to be reconciled against existing data on the patient record, the latter happening when the receiving system is likely to contain data not known to the system originating the RSP^K11 message. The data within any single order group (set of one ORC segment, one RXA segment and associated RXR and OBX segments, if any) should represent the complete set of data about the vaccination event as known by the system originating the message. A complete set of data is defined by the required (as per this implementation guide) and locally agreed to data elements.
 </li>
	<li>
  Z42 (Return Evaluated History and Forecast): The goal of a Z42 message is to return an evaluated history and forecast in response to a query request. It is intended to be displayed back to the requesting provider to inform clinical care. The evaluated history portion of the message contains all immunizations for the patient known to the responding system. Each of these will be evaluated against a set of rules, such as ACIP. The forecast portion of the message should be considered to be a complete representation of the patient forecast. This message is not intended to return all the details expected of a complete immunization history. This message may not include information about Lot Number or other data in a complete history, for instance. A Z34 query and Z32 response should be used for that purpose. The data within any single order group (set of one ORC segment, one RXA segment and associated RXR and OBX segments, if any) should represent the complete set of data about the vaccination event as known by the system originating the message. A complete set of data is defined by the required (as per this implementation guide) and locally agreed to data elements.
