<p>Various fields and data types, such as PID-5, PID-11 and ERL, contain references to &ldquo;repetitions&rdquo;. The word repetition is intended to be synonymous with the word occurrence. That is, the &ldquo;first repetition&rdquo; is not the &ldquo;second occurrence&rdquo;. For example, if the value of PID-3 is &ldquo;1234^^^AA1^MR~5678^^^AA2^DL&rdquo;, &ldquo;1234^^^AA1^MR&rdquo; is the first repetition and &ldquo;5678^^^AA2^DL&rdquo; is the second repetition.</p>
