<p>Sometimes it is necessary to remove a previously submitted vaccination administration record. If the existing record must simply be deleted, that is it should never have been entered, then a second VXU^V04 message should be sent where all data in the message, including the ORC and RXA segments, is the same as the most recent message for the administration, except for the Action Code (RXA-21) which should be D. Importantly, the filler ID in ORC-3 should be the same between messages as this ID may be crucial to identifying the correct administration to remove. Once the inaccurate data has been deleted, additional independent messages (adds, refusals, etc.) can be sent to accurately populate the receiving system.</p>
