<p>
 All response messages (profiles Z23, Z32, Z31, Z33 and Z42) should be returned synchronously. That is, the receiving process gives the response immediately or in a short period during which the originating process will wait for the response. The originating process will not send a new message until a response has been received. A system may initiate multiple simultaneous processes if allowed, but each process must wait for a response to a given message before sending the next one. For query interactions, this behavior is controlled by the constrained value of &ldquo;I&rdquo; in the Query Priority (RCP-2) field. See Chapter 5 of the HL7 2.5.1 Base Standard for more details.

<p>
 Profiles Z22, Z34 and Z44 have constrained values of ER for Accept Acknowledgement Type (MSH-15) and AL for Application Acknowledgement Type (MSH-16). When processing a message conformant with one of these profiles, the receiving system shall evaluate the message for unsupported message types, version ID, and processing IDs or other issues unrelated to format or content. If the message fails this validation, an ACK message conforming to profile Z23 shall be returned. This is consistent with &ldquo;ER&rdquo; in MSH-15. Messages which pass this initial validation are then processed and an appropriate Application level response message is returned. This is consistent with &ldquo;AL&rdquo; in MSH-16. Note that messages which fail the initial validation are not processed further and therefore do not have the opportunity to trigger an Application level response message. The receiving system only returns one message per incoming message. This process is diagrammed in Figure 37 (Z22 profile), Figure 41 (Z34 profile) and Figure 44 (Z44 profile).
