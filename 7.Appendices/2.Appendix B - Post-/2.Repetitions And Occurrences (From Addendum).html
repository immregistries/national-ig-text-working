<p>
 Various fields and data types, such as PID-5, PID-11 and ERL, contain references to “repetitions”. The word repetition is intended to be synonymous with the word occurrence. That is, the “first repetition” is not the “second occurrence”. For example, if the value of PID-3 is “1234^^^AA1^MR~5678^^^AA2^DL”, “1234^^^AA1^MR” is the first repetition and “5678^^^AA2^DL” is the second repetition.
