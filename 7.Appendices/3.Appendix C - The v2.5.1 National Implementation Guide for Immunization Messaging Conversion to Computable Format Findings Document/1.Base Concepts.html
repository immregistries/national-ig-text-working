<p>IGAMT includes newer conformance methodology, or further specifications to the v2.5.1 base standard, that were not originally included in the National IG. The following concepts that have been used in the computable national IG as part of the IGAMT Conformance methodology are further defined below:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><table aria-rowcount="15" border="1" data-tablelook="1184" data-tablestyle="MsoNormalTable"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="width: 99.9209%;"><div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Table 1: Base Concepts Used in the ICIG </strong></div></td></tr><tr aria-rowindex="1"><td data-celllook="69905" style="width: 8.4034%;"><p>Concept&nbsp;</p></td><td data-celllook="69905" style="width: 91.5182%;"><p>Definition&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr aria-rowindex="2"><td colspan="2" data-celllook="69905"><p>Base HL7 Concept&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr aria-rowindex="3"><td data-celllook="69905" style="width: 8.4034%;"><p>Flavor&nbsp;</p></td><td data-celllook="69905" style="width: 91.5182%;"><p>Constraints on &nbsp;base HL7 value sets, data types, or segments to meet use case requirements.&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr aria-rowindex="4"><td colspan="2" data-celllook="69905"><p>Data type, Segment, and Profile Concepts&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr aria-rowindex="5"><td data-celllook="69905" style="width: 8.4034%;"><p>Cardinality&nbsp;</p></td><td data-celllook="69905" style="width: 91.5182%;"><p>Indicator of the minimum and maximum number of times the element may appear.&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr aria-rowindex="6"><td data-celllook="69905" style="width: 8.4034%;"><p>Conformance Statements&nbsp;</p></td><td data-celllook="69905" style="width: 91.5182%;"><p>Constrains components of HL7 messages to conform to needed aspects of a use case.&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr aria-rowindex="7"><td colspan="2" data-celllook="69905"><p>Value Set Related Concepts&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr aria-rowindex="8"><td data-celllook="69905" style="width: 8.4034%;"><p>Extensibility&nbsp;</p></td><td data-celllook="69905" style="width: 91.5182%;"><p>Indicates if a value set can be extended by local trading partner agreement. Open extensibility indicates that trading partners have the latitude to include additional values to meet local needs. If a code exists in the value set for the concept that is being conveyed, then the implementer must use the code specified (i.e., a local code cannot be used as a substitute). Closed extensibility indicates that the value set cannot be extended while adhering to the profile, even by local agreement. Note that even if the value set is closed, the document authors may choose to extend or modify the value set in future versions of the specification.&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr aria-rowindex="9"><td data-celllook="69905" style="width: 8.4034%;"><p>Stability&nbsp;</p></td><td data-celllook="69905" style="width: 91.5182%;"><p>Indicates how the value set is bound to an underlying coding system. A stability of static indicates that the value set is fixed both in terms of attributes and values. If a value set needs to be modified, it must be done through the publication of a new value set and specification. A stability of dynamic indicates that the value set can evolve as the underlying coding systems change independent of the publication of the specification. For example, the CVX coding system identifies vaccines and new CVX codes are added periodically. The vaccine value set based on CVX has a stability of dynamic meaning that as new codes are added, conformant systems are expected to support them even though the new codes are not published explicitly in the specification.&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr aria-rowindex="10"><td data-celllook="69905" style="width: 8.4034%;"><p>Content&nbsp;</p></td><td data-celllook="69905" style="width: 91.5182%;"><p>indicates how values are specified in the value set.
