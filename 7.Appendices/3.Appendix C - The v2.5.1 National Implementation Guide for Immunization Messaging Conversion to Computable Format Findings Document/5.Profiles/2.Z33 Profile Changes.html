 The most significant profile change was to Z33, where three segments (RDF, RDT, and DSC) appear in IGAMT but do not appear in the National IG.&acirc;&euro;&macr; In the National IG, the Z33 Profile does not include the RDF, RDT, and DSC segments. However, in IGAMT, these segments are included, as they are a part of the base v2.5 standard. As such, these segments were listed as having an &ldquo;X&rdquo; for usage and [0 .. 0] for cardinality. Details of changes affecting message profiles can be found in Table 9.&acirc;&euro;&macr;&acirc;&euro;&macr;&acirc;&euro;&macr;
