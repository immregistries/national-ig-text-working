 The most significant profile change was to Z33, where three segments (RDF, RDT, and DSC) appear in IGAMT but do not appear in the National IG. In the National IG, the Z33 Profile does not include the RDF, RDT, and DSC segments. However, in IGAMT, these segments are included, as they are a part of the base v2.5 standard. As such, these segments were listed as having an "X" for usage and [0 .. 0] for cardinality. Details of changes affecting message profiles can be found in Table 9.
