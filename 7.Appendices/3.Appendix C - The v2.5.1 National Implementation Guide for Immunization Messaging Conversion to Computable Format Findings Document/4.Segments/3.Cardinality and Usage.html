<p>
 There were usage and cardinality changes to the segments in IGAMT, with some of these changes due to IGAMT conformance methodology. For example, cardinality is a required field in IGAMT, and thus, cardinality information was added to certain fields where cardinality was not previously addressed in the National IG. Similarly, usage was added to certain fields in the RCP_IZ02 segment, as usage is required in IGAMT, but was not stated in the National IG. For more information about these points, and others, please see the&rdquo; Segment Differences from the National IG Due to Conformance Methodology in IGAMT&rdquo; section of this appendix.

<p>
 While most changes to the cardinality and usage of segment fields were due to the conformance methodology of IGAMT, there were two usage changes of segment fields, MSA-5, and ORC-10, and one change in cardinality for MSH-21, due to the reduction process for segment flavors. For more information, please see the &ldquo;v2.5.1 Clarification Points&rdquo; section.
