 The workgroup found that reducing the number segment flavors needed in the National IG greatly reduced the complexity of the National IG, as such, the workgroup adopted two main approaches &ndash; relocating conformance statements from the message segment to the message profile level and changing the usage and cardinality in the segments. Of the eight profiles where segment flavors occur in the National IG, most of the segment flavors were similar enough that the number of flavors could be reduced to one or two flavors. For example, MSH and MSA which had eight flavors in the original national IG were collapsed into a single flavor for each segment. At the end of the review, the workgroup concluded that there were four segments with more than one flavor: OBX, PID, RCP, and RXA.&acirc;&euro;&macr; More information on collapsing segment flavors can be found in the &ldquo;v2.5.1 Clarification Points&rdquo; section.&acirc;&euro;&macr;
