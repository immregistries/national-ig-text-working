 There are occasions when a system that has sent an immunization record to another system wishes to delete the record on the other system. Each system may have rules about the requester’s right to delete records.

 If a system allows deletions by HL7 message, use the RXA-21, Action Code to request deletion of a specific record. The following diagram illustrates how the ORC-3 may be used to identify an immunization record for deletion

 . Note that the sending system includes the sending system unique id for the immunization in the ORC-3 first component. The second component is the assigning authority, in this case a system that is labeled MYIIS. In order for a later delete request to be successful, the receiving system must store those values. A subsequent request to delete an immunization record includes the sending system id and assigning authority. The receiving system searches for an immunization record with the same sending system id and assigning authority. In this case we show that the record match is made, and the record is deleted from the receiving system.
