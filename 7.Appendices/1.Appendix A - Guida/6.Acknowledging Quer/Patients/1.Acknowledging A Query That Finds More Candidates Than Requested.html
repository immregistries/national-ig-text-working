<p>The sending system sets an upper limit on the number of candidates it will accept in response to a query in RCP-2. It expects that a responding system will send no more candidates that this number. In addition, the responding system may have an upper limit on the number of candidates that it will return. This number may be lower than the requesting system. It will trump the requesting system upper limit. In either case, if the responding system finds more candidates than the upper limit, then it responds with and acknowledgement indicating that too many candidates were found. QAK-2 indicates that there were too many candidates found that matched the query parameters.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif,-webkit-standard;">MSH|^~\&amp;|MYIIS|MyStateIIS||MYEHR|200911300000-0500||RSP^K11^RSP_K11|7731029|P|2.5.1|||NE|NE|||||Z33^CDCPHINVS|MyStateIIS|MYEHR &lt;CR&gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif,-webkit-standard;">MSA|AA|793543&lt;CR&gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif,-webkit-standard;">QAK|37374859|TM|Z34^request Immunization history^CDCPHINVS&lt;CR&gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif,-webkit-standard;">QPD| Z34^Request Immunization History^CDCPHINVS |37374859|123456^^^MYEHR^MR|Child^Bobbie^Q^^^^L|Que^Suzy^^^^^M|20050512|M|10 East Main St^^Myfaircity^GA^^^L&lt;CR&gt;</span></p>
